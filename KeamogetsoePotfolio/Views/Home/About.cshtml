                    <p>My journey into software development has been anything but linear, shaped by curiosity, resilience, and an unyielding drive to find my true passion. From my early school days at Hamilton Primary, Loreto, and Prestige College, I've always been driven by learning and growth.</p>
                    <p>My initial foray into higher education led me to UNISA to study law, a path I soon realized didn't ignite my passion. This pivotal moment taught me the importance of pursuing what truly resonates. I then transitioned to Pearson for a BSc in Software Engineering, a field that immediately captivated me. Unfortunately, unforeseen financial challenges during the lockdown forced me to pause my studies prematurely, a difficult setback that only strengthened my resolve.</p>
                    <p>During this period, my entrepreneurial spirit led me into real estate, where I honed invaluable skills in communication, negotiation, and problem-solving, all while strategically building finances for my education. I also embraced a role as an event coordinator at a lounge, managing DJs and creating memorable events – an experience that sharpened my organizational and leadership abilities. Even amidst these diverse ventures, I co-founded a company called Bokantswe with friends, securing a project at GEMS. Though it ultimately faced political hurdles and a toxic group dynamic, it was a profound lesson in resilience and navigating complex environments.</p>
                    <p>My path eventually led me back to software development at Rosebank College, where I truly found my calling. This is where my passion for creating functional, beautiful, and intuitive user experiences (UX/UI) truly blossomed. Today, I am deepening my expertise in an intensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) Bootcamp at Capaciti, transforming innovative ideas into tangible, user-centric solutions.</p>
                    <p>Beyond coding, I have a deep enjoyment for understanding how things work, which extends to hands-on mechanical work. I even attempted to register for mechanical engineering, but when the TVET school systems didn't pick up my application, I decided to embrace it as a fulfilling hobby, performing minor and major services on cars, changing filters, and adjusting suspensions just for fun. Every step of my journey, every challenge overcome, has equipped me with a unique blend of technical acumen, interpersonal skills, and an unwavering commitment to bringing creative visions to life through code.</p>
